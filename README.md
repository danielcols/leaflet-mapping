# leaflet-challenge

The result of this effort is a comprehensive earthquake visualization that effectively conveys the geographical distribution, magnitude, and depth of recent seismic activity. The map's interactivity and informative markers enhance the user's engagement with the dataset. In the process of visualizing earthquake data, I successfully completed the following steps:

-Obtained earthquake dataset from the USGS GeoJSON Feed, selecting a specific dataset such as "All Earthquakes from the Past 7 Days."

-Utilized the provided JSON representation of the chosen dataset to extract earthquake data for visualization.

-Employed Leaflet to design an interactive map that accurately plotted the geographical locations of all earthquakes, utilizing their respective longitude and latitude coordinates.

-Created data markers on the map, where the size of the marker reflected the magnitude of each earthquake, while the color indicated the depth of the seismic event. Larger markers represented higher magnitudes, and darker colors depicted greater depths.

-Implemented popups for each marker, enabling additional information about the earthquake to be displayed upon clicking the respective marker.

-Designed a contextual legend that provided an informative overview of the earthquake data, enhancing the viewer's understanding of the map.
